# UTA-Bootcamp-Challenge4

# The Quiz Show 

## Description 
At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

For this challenge I am creating "The Quiz Show". This is a coding quiz that will teach the user some basic fundamentals in the knowledge of Javascript questions. There is no reason that learning cannot be fun! I hope you enjoy this fun little game. Thank you.
